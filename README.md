# EvoGyre
Gyruss-inspired game written with LibGDX

## Introduction


## Gameplay


## Features
All motion calculations are done on a rectangular map that wraps around in the y-direction.
The map positions are projected onto the funnel shape display.
Y ranges from 0 to 360 and corresponds to a position on the cross-section of the funnel.
X corresponds to the distance down the funnel and does not wrap.
